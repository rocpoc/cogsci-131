In this way, the state variables $(s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_T)$ form a **Markov chain**. It is assumed that each observation variable $w_t$ depends only on the corresponding state variable, $s_t$ (this is reflected in the diagram aboveâ€”at step $t$ an observation node/variable $w_t$ is connected to a single state node/variable $s_t$)."

The first is *state estimation*, where the model parameters are all known, and we are trying to recover the sequence of hidden states $(s_1,s_2,\\ldots,s_T)$ from the sequence of observations $(w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_T)$. In our language modeling context, this would be like assuming we already have a good model of English grammar that specifies the HMM model parameters, and we want to take an observed English sentence and perform part-of-speech tagging to determine the part of speech (e.g., adjective, noun, or preposition) of each word in the sentence. The second application of HMMs is *parameter estimation*, where the model parameters are unknown, and we are trying to recover them from only a set of observation sequences of the form $(w_1,w_2,\\ldots,w_T)$. Because the hidden state variables are also unknown when performing parameter estimation, they must also be estimated simultaneously. In this situation, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is used to perform simultaneous state estimation and parameter estimation.\n"

    "Yes, the HMM model was able to determine the correct POS for each occurence of these words. I think the HMM model was able to accomplish this disambiguation task aptly because essentially figuring out the next part of speech for the word is directly tied to the word before it. The HMM model knows the previous state (or word), and encorporates this into making the decision into the next one. Therefore, if there was any ambiguity in the word's POS, like in the example: 'sally' 'dogs' 'big' 'exhausted' 'john', where 'dogs' was classified as a verb, the model could tell that the probability of 'dogs' being a noun, *after* the first noun is much lower than being a verb, and therefore correctly predicts it in this case, and all of the other ones as well."
